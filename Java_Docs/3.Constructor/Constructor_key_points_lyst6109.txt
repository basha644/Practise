--> Constructor is a special type of method where the name is same as class name
-->Constructor can be reffered as special type of setter whose name is same as that of a class name and it is invocked during Object creation.
   Also it doesn't have any explicit return type.

--> If there is a call to Constructor and Programmer has not included any Constructor in a class then JavaC
    Would include a default Constructor.(Zero parametrized Constructor)

--> However if programmer has included any Constructor, whther is parametrized or zero parametirzed
    then javaC would not include any default Constructor.

--> Having more than One Constructor with Different parameters within a same class can be reffered as Constructor Overloading

--> If there are any statements are to be executed the moment we create object of a class than we must include that within Constructor bcz Constructor is invocked when we create an Object.


--> In Every Constructor the first statement, there would be super() call by default. If programmer is included explicitly this() then super() not possible.
    Because in a Constructor first statement either we can have super() or we can have this() but not the both.

--> Constructor chaining refers to process of one Constructor calling another Constructor. This can be achieved using super() and this(). 

--> super() is used to call parent class Constructor
--> Super keyword always refer to the parent class fields(super.name),methods(super.method()), Constructors(super())

--> this() is used to call Constructor within same class.
--> this keyword always refer to the preseny class fields(this.name),methods(this.method()), Constructors(this())
============================================================================================================
--> In Inheritance while creating child object(If constructor is available) at that time, first it calls the parent class constructor(because of super()) after it will be execute.

Main method can be overloaded in java. However JVM would invoke only a main method which is having String[]args as parameter.

Whenever program start at that time first loaded static fields, static block after that main method.
